It works with Python-docx; its main function is reading the ` 模板变量.txt ` file and pasting each value corresponding the variable in the template.

- `variable` Variables here are not the same as ones in program. The variables here look like `{项目名称}`, and it's used to highlight and mark the place that should be modified.
- `value` Values here are similar to the ones in program. The values here look like `阿姆不瑞爱勒花园`, which are keys to make the contract.

## Backgroud

Making contracts everyday is my main job as I am working in a real estate incoperation now. It's a tedious and cumbersome work, and I am always thinking about do it with a program. But unfortunately, there is no suitable program to do my job in my branch. So I decide to write one myself.
